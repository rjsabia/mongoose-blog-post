   The Mongoose Blog App
   =====================

   Purpose:
   --------

   At the core of this application is basically a simple Mongo
   Database that holds blog posting information. The information 
   includes a posting title, content, and an author. The purpose 
   of the build overall is to demonstrate the many layers involved 
   with the interaction with this data.


   Core Functionality:
   --------------------

   >Fundamentals are the foundation of fun
   >

   The Mongoose Blog Post App has a seeded cloud base database, hosted by Mlab. 
   It also uses Travis CI to consistantly update changes to the build, and the 
   overall Node app is also running on Heroku. When any changes are made to the 
   app, Travis runs the built in server test, and then on successful completion
   auto deploys the changes to Heroku.



   Hope you enjoy!!!
